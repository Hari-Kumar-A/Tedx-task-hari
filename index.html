                <br>The journey of mine starts with random YT video (solving JEE questions by a teacher..)<br>
                The first time when I took a pen, a notebook,picked up my first question from Units <br>and Dimension of Grade 11
                 JEE Physics! It was awesome feeling! I felt like warrior!.</p>

                        grade/percentage, I treated each and every day as a new opportunity and<br>
                        its importance for my JEE journey!</li>

                        Chemistry, I who did 10+ readings of each and every word of NCERT Chemistry like Bible!<br>
